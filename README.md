# code-tara

**AI-assisted code review, powered by Claude Code or Codex CLI.**

Paste a GitHub PR link → tara reads the whole diff, groups changes into logical review chunks, writes a walkthrough for each one, suggests inline comments you can edit and post directly to GitHub, and lets you chat with it about any part of the code.


---

## Features

- **Contextual chunking** — tara decides how to group changed files, not a dumb heuristic. Each chunk gets a purpose, a walkthrough, and a suggested reading order.
- **Inline comments** — AI-suggested comments are anchored to real diff lines. Edit, delete, or post them directly to GitHub with one click.
- **Chat per chunk** — ask tara anything about a specific set of changes. It has access to the full cloned repo.
- **Thread discussion** — see existing PR comments with replies nested. Ask tara about any thread: "is this concern valid?", "how should I address this?"
- **Re-review** — after you've pushed fixes, hit the Re-review tab: tara summarizes what changed since the last review and gives an opinion on each open thread (can resolve / needs a reply).
- **Requested Reviews** — tara shows PRs where your review is requested. One click to start a review or re-review. PRs tara has already reviewed are badged with "tara reviewed · Xd ago".
- **Dual AI providers** — choose between Claude Code or Codex per review. Switch providers on the fly from the UI.
- **No API keys** — uses `claude` or `codex` CLI and `gh` CLI. Auth happens through the tools you already have.
- **Fully local** — SQLite database, cloned repos stay on your machine, nothing leaves except GitHub API calls.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Install |
|------|---------|
| `claude` CLI **or** `codex` CLI | [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code) → `claude auth login` **OR** [openai.com/codex](https://openai.com/codex) → `codex login` |
| `gh` CLI | [cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com) → `gh auth login` |
| Python 3.13+ | [python.org](https://python.org) |
| Node 18+ | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| `uv` | `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh \| sh` |

### Install & run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thesmallstar/code-tara
cd code-tara

make install   # installs Python + Node deps
make dev       # starts backend :8000 + frontend :3000
```

Open **http://localhost:3000**, paste a GitHub PR URL, and hit **let tara review it**.

## Usage

### 1. Paste a PR link

```
https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```

tara will:
1. Fetch the PR metadata, diffs, and existing comments from GitHub
2. Clone the repo locally (shallow, `--depth 1`) so it can read full file context
3. Generate a plain-English summary of what the PR does
4. Group changed files into logical review chunks (decided by tara, not rules)
5. For each chunk: write a walkthrough, summarize what changed, and suggest inline comments

### 2. Walk through each chunk

Each chunk in the sidebar shows:
- **Purpose** — why these files belong together
- **How to review this** — what to focus on, what to watch for
- **What changed** — bullet-point summary
- **tara's notes** — specific concerns and suggestions
- **Diff** — in tara's suggested reading order, with hover buttons to add your own comments

### 3. Review and send comments

AI-suggested comments land in **tara's drafts**. You can:
- **Edit** the body before posting
- **Delete** ones you don't agree with
- **Send to GitHub** — posts as an inline review comment on the exact line

### 4. Discuss threads

Open the **Threads** tab to see existing PR comments with all replies. Threads show colored diff hunks with an **outdated** badge when the code has changed since the comment. Hit **ask tara** on any thread, or **resolve** to mark it done locally.

### 5. Re-review

After pushing fixes, open the **Re-review** tab inside the review page. Tara will:
1. Compare the current head commit to when it last reviewed
2. Summarize what changed
3. Go through each open thread and give an opinion — "can resolve" or "respond first" with a reason

### 6. Re-run

Hit **re-run tara** in the top bar to re-fetch the PR and re-run the full review (useful when you want a fresh chunk analysis).
